I was piled with countless nightmares
As an abyss that the world belied
Lock myself deep in stillness and quiet
In a room denying entry with no light
Touch fallen ashes and have a taste of your felt delight
Like a buried monster sniffs a rose sent by a tide
Whenever you need me, in me you could confide
I‘ll always be well armoured and bide my time
Unwind! Ditch all the futile ties
When the star casts its tiny lights to my night
Be fiery lava raging around and breaking silence
Indulge myself in the burning sky
(hum……hmmm )
Step into a room with no light
Where the solitude is amplified
Still try to clean and wipe your nightmares
Even when the gloom has blurred my sight
Feel my heartbeats before your minds confined by desires
Even a dim glow still pulsates in the chaotic night
Whenever you need me, in me you could confide
I keep the faith that on you I could rely
Detach! Release the hidden might
Driven by cravings for your starry eyes
Be fiery lava raging around and breaking silence
And by your embrace, I’m mollified
Unwind! Ditch all the futile ties
When the star bursts into firm lights
Be fiery lava raging around and breaking silence
Return to dark when the end is nigh
